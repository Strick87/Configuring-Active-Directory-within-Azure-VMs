This screenshot shows the configuration of a virtual machine in Azure. The VM is set up with Windows 10 Pro (version 22H2), 2 vCPUs, and 8GB of memory. The administrator account has been configured, and the estimated monthly cost is displayed. This VM will serve as the base for deploying on-premises Active Directory in the cloud.
